title: Introduction
---


The remit of the [European Clinical Trials Data Base (EudraCT)](https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/result.html) is to provide open access to summaries of all registered clinical trial results; thus aiming to prevent non-reporting of negative results and provide open-access to results to inform future research. The amount of information required and the format of the results, however, imposes a large extra workload at the end of studies on Clinical Trial Units. In particular, the adverse-event-reporting component requires entering:
*	each unique combination of treatment group and safety event
*	for every such event above, a further 4 pieces of information  (body system, number of occurrences, number of subjects, number exposed) for non-serious events, plus an extra three pieces of data for serious adverse events (numbers of causally related events, deaths, causally related deaths).

This is the home page of a [NIHR](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/)-funded project to provide tools that will

*	prepare the required statistics needed by EudraCT
*	format them into the precise requirements to directly upload an XML file into the web portal, with no further data entry by hand.
