title: Bug Fix when SOC = Product Issue
date: 2020-02-12
---
A bug was detected with the version number associated with SOC "Product issues", where the default value of 19 is not accepted by the EudraCT portal. A fix is implemented in the simpleToEudraCT.xslt file that conditionally sets the version to be 3 for this SOC, and 22 for all other SOC values.

This change is effected across the zip files for SAS, Stata and R (from github), and will be shortly available from the R package on CRAN.
