\title{Calculate frequency tables from a rectangular data frame with one row per subject-event}
\usage{
safety_summary(data, exposed, excess_deaths = 0, freq_threshold = 0,
  soc_index = c("meddra", "soc_term"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data set containing the following columns: \code{subjid, pt, soc, serious, related, fatal, group}}

\item{exposed}{a numeric vector giving the numbers of subjects exposed in each group.
To ensure the ordering is correct either, name the vector with names matching the values in \code{data$group}, or
ensure that the data$group is an ordered factor, or relying on alphabetical ordering of the values in
\code{data$group}}

\item{excess_deaths}{a numeric vector giving the number of extra deaths not reporting within \code{data}. Defaults to 0.}

\item{soc_index}{a character vector either "meddra" or "soc_term", which is used to identify if the soc variable in data gives the numerical meddra code or the description in English.}

\item{filter}{a value on a percentage scale at which to remove events if the incidence falls below. Defaults to 0}
}
\value{
a list of three dataframes: GROUP, SERIOUS, NON_SERIOUS. Each contains the summary statistics required by EudraCT, and is suitable for export.
