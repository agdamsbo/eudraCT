Description: The remit of the European Clinical Trials Data Base (EudraCT) is to provide open access to summaries of all registered clinical trial results; thus aiming to prevent non-reporting of negative results and provide open-access to results to inform future research. The amount of information required and the format of the results, however, imposes a large extra workload at the end of studies on Clinical Trial Units. 
    In particular, the adverse-event-reporting component requires entering: each unique combination of treatment group and safety event;for every such event above, a further 4 pieces of information (body system, number of occurrences, number of subjects, number exposed) for non-serious events, plus an extra three pieces of data for serious adverse events (numbers of causally related events, deaths, causally related deaths).
    This package: prepares the required statistics needed by EudraCT; formats them into the precise requirements to directly upload an XML file into the web portal, with no further data entry by hand.
